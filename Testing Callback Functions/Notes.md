### TESTING CALLBACK FUNCTIONS

- Environment setup
- Asynchronous testin is even harder than synch...
- NodeJS / Mocha / Chai
- Mocha: JS test framework in nodejs and browser
- Chai: BDD/TDD ASSERTION LIBRARY for node and the browser that can be delightfully paired with any javascript testing framework.
  //Assertion libraries are tools to verify that things are correct. This makes it a lot easier to test your code, so you don't have to do thousands of if statements. Example (using should.js and Node.js assert module): var output = mycode. doSomething(); output.
